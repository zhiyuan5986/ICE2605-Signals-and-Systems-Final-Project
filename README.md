This is the final project of ICE2605, Signals and System, IEEE Honor Class, SJTU.
My lecturer is Bo Jiang.

Contents:
* Report and figures are stored in the folder named "report and figure".
* Codes are stored in the folder named "code and audio".
  * The folder named "part1" stores the MATLAB code for part1. 
    * part1.m is the main program, you can just run it in your MATLAB terminal with command `part1`.
    * PlotWave.m is used to plot the waveform of a signal.
    * PlotSpectrum.m is used to plot the **complete** spectrum of a signal.
    * PlotSpectrumLocal.m is used to plot the spectrum of a signal in the interval of $[-f,f]$.
    * ILPF.m is an ideal lowpass filter, which can eliminate the high frequency components (larger than a specific cut-off frequency) completely. 
    * spring.wav is an audio clip from the soft music named *Spring* written by Joe Hisaishi.
  * The folder named "part2" stores the MATLAB code for part2. 
    * part2.m is the main program, you can run it in your MATLAB terminal with command `part2`.
    * Plotwave.m, PlotSpectrum.m and PlotSpectrumLocal.m are the same as those in part1.
    * ta.wav is the original audio clip, and ta0.wav-wa6.wav are the sampled version of ta.wav

Note: project.pdf is the question by my teacher, I have no copyright of it.
